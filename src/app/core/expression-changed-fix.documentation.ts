/**
 * ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked Fix Documentation
 * =======================================================
 * 
 * Problem:
 * The Angular ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked error (NG0100) occurs when 
 * a value bound to the template changes during the same change detection cycle.
 * 
 * Root Cause in AssessmentComponent:
 * - assessmentTitle was a regular property initialized with 'Assessment Title Here'
 * - During route changes, an HTTP request was triggered to fetch assessment data
 * - The LoadingInterceptor would trigger loading.show() synchronously
 * - The HTTP response would update assessmentTitle asynchronously
 * - This caused the bound value to change during the same change detection cycle
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1. Convert assessmentTitle and assessmentStatus to Angular signals
 * 2. Use signal() to create reactive state that properly notifies Angular of changes
 * 3. Update template to use signal syntax: {{ assessmentTitle() }}
 * 4. Update component logic to use signal.set() method
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Prevents ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked errors
 * - Provides better reactivity and change detection optimization
 * - Makes the component more compatible with Angular's signal-based future
 * - Improves debugging and error tracking
 * 
 * Error Monitoring Integration:
 * - The GlobalErrorHandler now recognizes NG0100 errors
 * - Provides user-friendly error messages for Angular-specific issues
 * - Reports structured error data to monitoring services
 * - Logs detailed context for debugging

// Example of the fix applied:

// BEFORE (problematic):
/*
export class AssessmentComponent {
  assessmentTitle = 'Assessment Title Here';
  assessmentStatus = 'In Progress';
  
  constructor() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      // ... HTTP call that updates assessmentTitle asynchronously
      this.assessmentTitle = data.title; // This causes NG0100 error
    });
  }
}
*/

// AFTER (fixed with signals):
/*
export class AssessmentComponent {
  assessmentTitle = signal('Assessment Title Here');
  assessmentStatus = signal('In Progress');
  
  constructor() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      // ... HTTP call that updates assessmentTitle properly
      this.assessmentTitle.set(data.title); // This works correctly
    });
  }
}
*/

// Template changes:
// BEFORE: {{ assessmentTitle }}
// AFTER:  {{ assessmentTitle() }}
